# opengl-haven
A project based around learning OpenGL. This repo will contain files about different rendering techniques and scenarios in OpenGL.

#### What will be demonstrated [✅/❌]:
**Stage #1**
- Making a Window [❌]
- Storing vertices [❌]
- Compiling shaders [❌]
- Drawing a triangle [❌]
- Loading Textures [❌]
- Applying Transformations [❌]
- Loading Object models [❌]

**Stage #2**
- Blinn-Phong Lighting [❌]
- Billboards [❌]
- Multiple Shaders [❌]
- Custom Framebuffers [❌]
- Text []
- Advanced Materials (e.g., Normal Mapping) [❌]

**Stage #3**
- Bloom [❌]
- Shadows [❌]
- Stencil buffer Usage [❌]
- Instanced rendering [❌]
- Deferred shading [❌]
- Screen-Space ambient occlusion [❌]

**Note:**   
After `stage #1` and `stage #2` you will have a good body of knowledge and be comfortable in OpenGL.  
Use `stage #3` for refinement. At this stage you will pick items and slot them into your current existing knowledge.  
We can start working on projects after `stage #1` and `stage #2` are understood, or perhaps a little into `stage #3`. 

#### Prerequisites
- cmake  
- glfw  
- libxrandr (package)

**Note:** You can execute the setup script: `setup.sh` in the base directory to configure glfw for you with cmake.
